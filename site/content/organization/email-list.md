You are encouraged to sign up to the Haptics Symposium email list, through which we distribute infrequent but important information about the IEEE Haptics Symposium.

We anticipate sending fewer than 20 messages to this list between July 2019 and March 2020.  Only a handful of these emails will be distributed more broadly.

If you want to join this Haptics Symposium email list, simply follow these steps:

1. Visit the [email list website](https://listserv.ieee.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=haptics&A=1)
2. Enter your email address into the form
3. Click "Subscribe (HAPTICS)"
4. Click the confirmation link that will be emailed to you

This same link also allows you to unsubscribe from the list and update the way you receive messages (digest or one at a time).

If you have any comments or questions about this email list, please contact [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](chairs@hapticssymposium.org).
