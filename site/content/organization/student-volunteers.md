## Student Volunteer Program





We are looking for a set of student volunteers (SVs) to help us run the 2020 IEEE Haptics Symposium.



**Important Dates**

\- Student Volunteer Applications Due:  February 4, 2020

\- Notifications: February 17, 2020

\- Conference: March 28-31, 2020, in Washington DC, USA



**General Information**

We are in the process of recruiting a team of reliable and enthusiastic students who will help us host and manage a successful, productive, and enjoyable conference. The student volunteer program is a great opportunity for young researchers to familiarize themselves with state-of-the-art haptics research. It also allows enthusiastic students to establish and expand their network with the most relevant members of the academy, professionals, and other scholars in the field.



A wide range of responsibilities will be assigned to SVs, such as:

•	Support at the registration desk

•	Help setting up and maintaining demos, posters, and exhibits

•	Audio and video support during oral sessions

•	Helping members of the organizing committee with other tasks



In general, no special skills are required except for a small number of positions where we are looking for individuals with good photography, social media, or A/V skills. Each volunteer is required to commit to about 12 hours spread across 2 to 4 days of the conference.



**Benefits**

For their time and efforts, student volunteers will receive complimentary housing (double occupancy room with another student volunteer) at the conference hotel for the entire duration of the conference. This benefit is a change from prior years, where registration was compensated. This year, student volunteers will be responsible for their own travel and registration expenses towards the conference. Lunch will be provided to volunteers on days that they work. 



**Requirements**

Student volunteers should have a positive “can do” attitude and good communication skills in English. Applicants must be undergraduate or graduate students during the 2019-2020 academic year. A valid, dated student identification card or a letter from your university must be presented when registering at the conference. Volunteers are required to show up 5-10 minutes before their allotted service times and to be available to help out for unforeseen needs, which are difficult to predict. We expect every volunteer to commit to a total of about 12 volunteer hours of work during the conference.

There will be an SV orientation on the evening of March 27th, 2020. Volunteers are required to attend the orientation, and all SVs should meet with the Student Volunteers Chair prior to their assignments. If you require a special exception to your arrival / departure times, please note this in your application, as only a small number of exceptions can be made.



**Application Process**

Please complete the online application form (COMING SOON!) to be considered as a Student Volunteer. After submission, you will see an acknowledgment page. We expect to receive more applications than will be needed, thus early application is encouraged. 



If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact the Student Volunteers Chair via sv@hapticssymposium.org directly.
