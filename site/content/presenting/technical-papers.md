# Technical Papers in Conference Proceedings

We solicit technical papers that report original, novel, unpublished work relevant to all the scientific, technological, and application aspects of haptics.

## **Paper Format**

Technical papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors' convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

## **Paper Length**

Authors should aim for a technical paper length of 6 pages or less, including references and all other components of the paper.

1 or 2 extra pages (beyond 6 pages) may added through a charge of $200 per page, paid during conference registration.

## **Author Names and Affiliations**

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner.

Author names and affiliations should be specified in all technical papers.

## **Submission Due Date**

~~20~~ **25** October, 2019 (11:59 p.m. Pacific Time)

## **Submission Method**

All technical papers (with optional videos) should be submitted using [PrecisionConference](https://new.precisionconference.com/haptics) (submission system will be open on 28 September, 2019).  Select the "Haptics Symposium" Society, "Haptics 2020" Conference, and "Haptics 2020 Technical Papers" Track. 

## **Presentation and Publication**

All accepted technical papers will be presented orally in a podium presentation, either in a dual-track regular session or in a single-track featured session.

All accepted papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and also published in IEEE Xplore.

Paper copyright will be transferred to the IEEE as part of the publication process.

Paper decisions will be announced on December 30, 2019, and will also be available in [PrecisionConference](https://new.precisionconference.com/haptics).

## **Videos**

Submission of videos is optional but strongly encouraged to help readers understand the paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 2 minutes), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB).  Final (but not initial) video submissions will need to include some simple additional files for IEEE Xplore compliance.

## **Final Submission**

All accepted technical papers will appear in this year's Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference and submitted to IEEE Xplore.

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program and the archival IEEE proceedings.  As such, authors will work within the established infrastructure of the [PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net).  To minimize confusion, we have provided details below on how to submit your accepted conference technical paper content to PaperPlaza.

**Step 1)**  _**Before January 15**_ – The submitting author must submit an “initial” conference technical paper placeholder to the “Contributed Papers” track.  

* The submitting author will need the title, author list, PaperPlaza PIN numbers of _all_ authors, and keywords.  
* At this time an abstract is not required, but authors may wish to upload an abstract since it will be required before final submission. The abstract must be limited to 750 characters (~100 words) and will be required for use in the conference program.  The final abstract within the pdf manuscript file is allowed to exceed 750 characters. 
* A pdf manuscript will not be required at this stage, although authors may wish to upload their original manuscript as a placeholder.  The pdf file size is limited to 10 MB.

**Step 2)**  The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the initial submission.

**Step 3)**  Shortly after the January 15 deadline for initial submission, the corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges acceptance of the technical paper for oral presentation. At this time, PaperPlaza will be open for the submission of final camera-ready conference technical papers via what is labelled as the “Contributed Papers” track in PaperPlaza.

**Step 4)**  _**Before ~~January 22~~ January 27**_ _–_ The corresponding author must submit the final camera-ready conference technical paper content to the "Contributed Papers" track.

* The title, author list, and keywords should be correct and final.  
* The abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words) should be finalized.  Note that the final abstract within the paper itself (pdf manuscript file) is allowed to exceed 750 characters. 
* Author affiliations, required ethical statements for experiments with human subjects, and funding acknowledgements should be checked.
* The final camera-ready pdf manuscript file of up to 10 MB must be uploaded.
  * Authors are requested to revise their manuscripts according to reviewer guidance.
  * Technical papers that were originally submitted to the Transactions on Haptics Short Paper track must be reformatted to use the conference technical paper template, which can be found at top of this page under "Paper Format". Please see the acceptance email for further details.
* Authors may optionally upload a final camera-ready video file of up to 40 MB in one of the following formats: mpeg, mpg, avi, mp4, wmv.  
  * IEEE requires a plain text Readme file of up to 10 kB for any accompanying multimedia content, such as video. The Readme file must contain (1) An overall description of the video file, (2) Multimedia player information, and (3) Author contact information.
  * IEEE requires a plain text Summary file of up to 10 kB for multimedia content.  The Summary file must describe in 5 sentences or less the contents of the video. This file helps IEEE Xplore users to make downloading decisions.

**Step 5)**  The corresponding author will receive a confirmation email that acknowledges receipt of the final submission.  If there are any issues, PaperPlaza staff will contact the corresponding author.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to ras.101@papercept.net.  General questions about the final submission of conference technical papers should be sent to the Publications Chair at publications@hapticssymposium.org.  Urgent general questions should be sent to the Program Chair at  program@hapticssymposium.org or the General Co-chairs at chairs@hapticssymposium.org.

## **Presentation Instructions**

One author from each technical paper will deliver the oral presentation in the time permitted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All presentations will be delivered from the speaker's own laptop computer to ensure the correct appearance of the slides. Please bring any required video adapters.  Both HDMI and VGA connections will be available, as well as audio output.

Authors can determine their presentation room and time from the detailed conference program.  (We ask that authors check the schedule again once the conference has begun to ensure they have the most up-to-date information.)

Presenters should check the connection with the conference projection system during a break before the session in which they are presenting, making sure all videos play on the screen.  Our on-site technician will be able to assist you with any issues.

We ask that all presenters arrive for their session at least ten minutes before it begins, check in with the session chairs, and sit near the front of the room to facilitate the change between speakers.
