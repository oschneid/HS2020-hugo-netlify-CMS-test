# **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Papers**

Work-in-Progress papers enable authors to share late-breaking results with the research community. The emphasis of WIP papers is on the novelty of the work, not completeness.

## Paper Format

WIP papers should be prepared according to the formatting instructions available [here](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/support.php).

For authors' convenience, the templates for technical papers can be downloaded in [Word](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/word.php) or [Latex](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) format. Note that only the US Letter template will be accepted, not the A4 template.

## Paper Length

WIP papers should be 2 pages including references.

One extra page (for a total of 3 pages) may be added through a charge of $200, paid during conference registration.

## Author Names and Affiliations

Submitted papers will be reviewed in single-blind manner.

Author names and affiliations should be specified on all WIP papers.

## Important Dates

**January 31, 2020**: 11:59 pm PST: WIP paper submission deadline

**February 12, 2020**: WIP acceptance notification

**February 21, 2020**: WIP final paper submission

## Submission Method

All WIP papers (including optional video) should be submitted using [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).  

## Publication

All accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings, but they will not be published in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp).

Authors retain the full copyright of WIP papers so that they can submit a more mature version of the paper at another time.

## Videos

Submission of a video is optional but encouraged to help readers understand the WIP paper.

Uploaded videos will be reviewed along with the paper.

Videos associated with accepted WIP papers will be included in the electronically distributed conference proceedings and may be used to promote the conference.

Guidelines: format (mpeg 4, .mp4), length (up to 60 seconds), resolution (at least 480p progressive scan), and file size (up to 40 MB).

## Final Submission

All accepted WIP Papers will appear in this year's Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be electronically distributed at the conference, but will not be submitted to IEEE Xplore. The authors of accepted WIP Papers will be asked to prepare a final version of their contribution, a 100-word abstract,  and the final version of the optional video.

## Presentation Instructions

Work-in-Progress papers will be presented through a short oral “teaser” presentation and a poster.

**WIP Teasers**

The WIP teasers will be presented on Sunday, March 29, between 2:00 and 2:30 pm in the session titled “Work-in-Progress Poster Teasers”. One author from each Work-in-Progress is invited to give a short presentation to introduce their poster to the audience. Each teaser presentation can last no more than 40 seconds.

The WIP teaser presentation should focus on the main ideas or results of the work. The purpose is to encourage the audience to visit the WIP poster, not to summarize the paper contents.

The presenters are asked to a prepare a single slide for their teaser presentation. The use of visual content, videos, and animations is encouraged. All animations and video playback should be programmed into the slide such that all event timing is automatic. Videos, if used, must be embedded in the slide. We recommend using [this slide template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EoGA4D_ClGZ9hQrqp2pnD-YYu4jdWW46/view?usp=sharing), which also contains additional formatting instructions. The poster location should be displayed in the upper right corner of the slide, and will soon be available in the conference program.

The teaser slide must be sent by email to the WIP Chair at <mailto:wip@hapticssymposium.org> no later than March 21, 2020. The file can be attached to the email or included as a link. Please inquire if you do not receive confirmation of receipt within 24 hours.

The presenters should arrive for the WIP teaser session at least ten minutes before it begins. The session chair and student volunteers will help the presenters line up. The order of the WIP teasers will correspond to the location of the posters.

**WIP Posters**

The WIP posters will be presented during a WIP poster session 8:00 to 9:30 pm on Sunday, March 29. The posters must fit on a poster board with dimensions of 44” x 44” (111.76 cm x 111.76 cm). The posters can be designed using any size, orientation, or format, as long as they fit within this allocated space. You are encouraged to include the [conference logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cy713kmBjW3uK2710KcFry7e3SNQPFQW/view?usp=sharing).

Authors are responsible for printing their own poster and bringing it to the conference. Push pins will be provided to install the posters on the poster boards. The posters must be installed during the hour preceding the WIP poster session, between 7:00 and 8:00 pm on Sunday, March 29. The posters must be taken down after the WIP Poster session, between 9:30 and 10:00 pm. A storage space will be available for authors who wish to leave their poster in storage during the day on Sunday, March 29.

Any questions about WIP papers can be addressed to the WIP chair (Heather Culbertson) at <mailto:wip@hapticssymposium.org>.
